AppRating is a simple yet powerful App Review Manager for iOS and OSX written in Swift. It is based on [Armchair](https://github.com/UrbanApps/Armchair) but mainly rewritten for Swift 5.0.

## Other Version

Flutter: https://pub.dev/packages/advanced_in_app_review

Android: https://github.com/grizzly/android-in-app-reviews/

## What's new?

- SKStoreReviewController - Now supporting the brand new iOS 10.3 API SKStoreReviewController which makes it really easy to get a huge number of ratings for your app. It opens the rating directly in an alert:

## Why AppRating?

The average end-user will only write a review if something is wrong with your App. This leads to an unfairly negative skew in the ratings, when the majority of satisfied customers donâ€™t leave reviews and only the dissatisfied ones do. In order to counter-balance the negatives, AppRating prompts the user to write a review, but only after the developer knows they are satisfied. For example, you may only show the popup if the user has been using it for more than a week, and has done at least 5 significant events (the core functionality of your App). The rules are fully customizable for your App and easy to setup.

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.0+ (get the beta version at [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/))
- iOS 10.3+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build AppRating.

To integrate AppRating into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.3'
use_frameworks!

pod 'AppRating', '>= 0.0.1'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate AppRating into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "grizzly/AppRating"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `AppRating.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Usage

### Simple 1-line Setup

AppRating includes sensible defaults as well as reads data from your localized, or unlocalized `info.plist` to set itself up. While everything is configurable, the only **required** item to configure is your App Store ID. This call should be made as part of your App Delegate's `initialize()` function

```swift
AppRating.appID("12345678")
```

That's it to get started. Setting AppRating up with this line uses some sensible default criterion (detailed below) and will present a rating prompt whenever they are met.

While the Swift community is still deciding on proper code structure and style, please refrain from simple style complaints (space > tabs, etc...)
